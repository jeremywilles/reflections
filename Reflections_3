When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Off site backups in case the computer crashes. Access to files from multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	may not be caught up, may result in work loss

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	fork - github creation, copy a repository to your github account

	clone - copy on machine

	branches - branch off master

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Good in case of error that results in data loss.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Probably just pass code around. Would be difficult track changes and merge different copies

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	Separate branches would be beyond bug fixes and adding a feature or cleaning up code.
