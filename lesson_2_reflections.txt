What happens when you initialize a respository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden folder is created to store meta-data about that repository. You need
	to do it so the meta data can be collected.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is holding for a commit. It has not been commited, but they are ready to. I suppose this would help if you need to back something out of the commit area..
