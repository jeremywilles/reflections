What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a

    pro - you decide when to create a commit, may be a natural breaking point
    or a time when it makes sense to create one, like if you fix a bug

    con - might forget

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    different use cases

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    see changes over time

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
